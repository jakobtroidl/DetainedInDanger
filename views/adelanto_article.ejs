            On May 28, 2020, at least 80 people <a
                    href="https://www.vvdailypress.com/news/20200528/rally-protests-conditions-at-adelanto-ice-center"
                    style="color:#275889; font-weight: bold">assembled outside</a> the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in San Bernardino
            County, California to protest ICE’s continued detention of vulnerable immigrants during the COVID-19
            pandemic. Within a day, ICE announced that a 38-year-old immigrant from Belize <a
                    href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2020/05/29/ice-first-covid-19-case-adelanto-immigration-detention-center/5287103002/"
                    style="color:#275889; font-weight: bold">tested positive</a> for the virus
            at the Adelanto facility.

            <br><br>

            The protest is one example of an effort that includes immigration advocacy groups and lawyers who are
            working tirelessly to free detainees with pre-existing health conditions before they are exposed to the
            deadly virus.

            <br><br>

            Despite over 5,500 cases in the surrounding county, the sprawling facility located in the Mojave desert has
            reported three cases of the virus amongst its 1,112 detainees. Adelanto is the largest ICE detention
            facility in California and is run by GEO Group, a private prison company contracted to manage ICE detainees.
            It is one of many ICE detention centers around the country that has reported low numbers of infections,
            months into the pandemic. At least one ICE employee and one ICE contract employee who worked at Adelanto
            have tested positive for COVID-19.

            <br><br>

            <a href="https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/public-health-experts-medical-doctors-prison-experts-and-former-ice-officials-urge-releases"
               style="color:#275889; font-weight: bold">Experts have warned</a> of the possibility of COVID-19 spreading like wildfire among incarcerated populations.
            The health situation at Adelanto is especially concerning since the facility has a history of inadequate
            medical care. A <a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2018-10/OIG-18-86-Sep18.pdf"
                               style="color:#275889; font-weight: bold">2018 report</a> from the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security
            listed “failure to provide timely and adequate medical care for detainees” and found that some detainees had
            to wait months to see doctors, citing 80 medical grievances filed between November 2017 and April 2018.

            <br><br>

            Luis Lopez Salgado, a former detainee who entered Adelanto in August 2018, said in an interview that medical
            delays continued to be a major problem during his time in the facility; at one point, he waited a week to
            get treated for the flu.

            <br><br>

            Other detainees echoed this sentiment, stating in April 2020 declarations as part of an on-going lawsuit
            that medical problems are not taken seriously “unless you have collapsed or are unconscious.” Meanwhile, ICE
            claims that “comprehensive medical care is provided to all individuals in ICE custody to ensure everyone in
            our custody receives timely access to services and treatment.”

            <br><br>

            Before Salgado was released as part of an ACLU lawsuit on April 3, 2020, he was “really scared” that he
            would get COVID-19 and die in Adelanto.

            <br><br>

            Even the number of detainees who have been tested for COVID-19 has been a matter of debate. According to ICE
            reports, six detainees were tested before April 23. However, when asked for updated numbers in mid-May as
            part of Roman v. Wolf, an attempt to release more detainees from Adelanto, an ICE official confirmed that
            three people were tested between April 23 and May 13 and two detainees were tested between May 13 and May
            19. This would bring the total number of detainees tested to eleven. However, the day after confirming the
            testing numbers for April 23 to May 13, the official stated that fifteen detainees had been tested. Other
            documents from ICE also placed the number at fifteen, though it is unclear when or why each detainee was
            tested. As of May 21, over two months after the major COVID-19 outbreak began in the United States, only
            1.3% of detainees at Adelanto had been tested.

            <br><br>

            The ACLU and other immigration advocacy groups, including Human Rights First, have been suing to have
            detainees with underlying conditions released from ICE detention. Four women were <a href="https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/press-release/immigrants-released-ice-detention-federal-covid-19-lawsuit-brought-human-rights-first"
                                                                                                 style="color:#275889; font-weight: bold">released from Adelanto</a> on
            April 10th because of a suit filed by Human Rights First.

            <br><br>

            Multiple people who were detained in Adelanto in March and April said that little changed inside the
            detention center despite the drastic actions that were being taken around the country to curb the spread of
            COVID-19. Detainees learned about the virus from the news while ICE was slow to react and provided detainees
            with little, if any, guidance on how to effectively protect themselves from getting sick.

            <br><br>

            Robert*, a detainee who was in Adelanto for over three years, described how ICE tried to implement social
            distancing guidelines at meals. In an interview, he explained how stickers were placed on certain seats in
            the dining hall and the detainees were let into the room in smaller groups than usual. But he said this new
            system initially only lasted for one day, and after that the dining hall was full again. He thinks the
            leadership at the facility was not taking the situation seriously and, therefore, did not put sustained
            effort into protecting the detainees.

            <br><br>

            Robert also described a lack of cleaning supplies, a concern echoed by Salgado and other detainees. Both men
            explained that detainees were expected to clean the facility but did not have access to adequate soap and
            disinfectant. Salgado related how he asked a guard for more cleaning supplies and was told to use shampoo.
            ICE maintains that it is “fully committed to ensuring that those in our custody reside in a safe, secure,
            and clean environment.” When asked what ICE could have done to ameliorate the panic caused by COVID-19, he
            answered that he would have felt safer “if they would have responded quicker to little things like getting
            cleaning supplies.”

            <br><br>

            In the months since Salgado was released, ICE has changed its disinfectant process at Adelanto and is now
            accused of spraying toxic chemicals in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. According to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6923000-Adelanto-CRCL-Complaint-052120.html"
                                                                                                                 style="color:#275889; font-weight: bold">compliant</a>
            filed by The Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice and Freedom for Immigrants, since May 11, guards have
            started spraying HDQ Neutral disinfectant inside the facility. “They spray it on the phones, chairs, tables,
            every 15-20 minutes - all day & all night long,” said one detainee. Headaches, bloody noses, trouble
            breathing and burning eyes have been reported since the spray began being used in living areas.

            <br><br>

            In an emailed statement, ICE spokesperson Alexx Pons stated “Disinfectant formulations used at Adelanto are
            compliant with detention standards, registered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and used
            according to manufacture instructions for routine cleaning and maintenance of the facility. Any assertion or
            claim to the contrary is false.”

            <br><br>

            And yet despite all the health concerns at Adelanto, ICE has not stopped transferring people into the
            facility. According to court documents, 600 detainees were brought to Adelanto between March 1, 2020 and
            April 24, 2020. Robert was told that newcomers were isolated for 14 days before being housed with the
            general population in Adelanto, but when he spoke to the new detainees, they contradicted the guards and
            said they had not been isolated. This only added to the sense of fear within the segmented facility.

            <br><br>

            Detainees were distrustful of official reports that said there was no COVID-19 in Adelanto. Robert described
            a group of older men who were to be moved to a new part of the facility, presumably because they were a
            higher risk population, but they were scared by the prospect of living with a new group of people.They were
            confident their pod had no cases but were afraid people in other parts of the facility might be infected. A
            judge authorized a preliminary injunction which stopped the transfer of people into Adelanto on April 23,
            but the ruling was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-05/judge-ordered-ice-release-california-immigrants-overruled-detainees-will-stay-put"
                                  style="color:#275889; font-weight: bold">overturned</a> by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on May 5.

            <br><br>

            When asked about concerns related to transfers, Pons replied with a list of reasons why a person could be
            transferred, including “to provide appropriate medical or mental health care to the detainee; to fulfill an
            approved transfer request by the detainee; to protect the safety and security of the detainee, other
            detainees, or detention personnel.” The spokesperson also noted that ICE’s “proactive measures” include,
            “cohorting or isolating new admissions into the detention network for 14 days before placing them into
            general population.”

            <br><br>

            As of early June, ICE has tested approximately 20% of people in it’s custody. Over a thousand ICE detainees
            have tested positive for COVD-19, and yet testing is still not widespread, suggesting there are far more
            detainees who actually have the virus. Adelanto is one of many ICE facilities which claims to have only a
            few COVID-19 cases, but testing rates vary significantly across facilities.

            <br><br>

            ICE’s response to the unprecedented health crisis has put extra stress on detainees, many of whom are
            already concerned about their health due the poor baseline of care that is provided in the facility.
            Meanwhile ICE claims that it “ takes very seriously the health, safety and welfare of those in our care.”
            Two people in ICE detention have died of COVID-19 as of June 9, 2020.

            <br><br>

            When Robert was released in April, his fellow detainees said, “hope we see you again if we don’t get sick in
            here.”

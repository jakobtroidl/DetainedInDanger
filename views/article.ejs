            Google “COVID-19 in ICE Detention Centers.” The results show a common theme: ICE detention centers are <a
                    href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/05/05/coronavirus-ice-detention-rural-communities-186688"
                    style="color:#275889">“like Petri dishes for the virus.”</a>

            <br><br>

            Even before the pandemic, ICE Detention Centers held a reputation for being uncleanly and inhumane: packed
            blocks, filthy communal bathrooms, rationed soap. Inmates have long been <a
                    href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-19/immigrant-detention-medical-care-lawsuit"
                    style="color:#275889">denied adequate healthcare</a>. The
            current pandemic has only highlighted the pre-existing vulnerabilities of the ICE detainee population.
            Subjugated to packed cell blocks, sharing dirty communal bathrooms, and lacking adequate access to testing
            PPE, ICE detainees have experienced the madness and anxiety of the COVID-19, unlike anything the American
            public could imagine.

            <br><br>

            The media has spent weeks covering New York City--the epicenter of the pandemic--and an outpouring of
            compassion, donations, and supplies from across the country followed. Americans felt for New Yorkers,
            quarantined inside shoebox apartments.

            <br><br>

            But as the pandemic rips through prisons and detention centers across the country, the media coverage has
            hardly covered an even grimmer reality: life inside the ICE cell block. The average household size in New
            York City is 2.42 residents living in 866 square feet. Detainees in Otay Mesa Detention Center split 250
            square feet between 6-8 person cells. Worse yet, detainees from different cells often share communal
            bathrooms between over 90 people.

            <br><br>

            As attorney Ginger Jacobs reports, “social distancing is impossible.”

            <br><br>


            Further exacerbating conditions, detainees held in locations throughout the country report poor sanitation.
            Detention centers refuse to provide hand sanitizer due to the alcohol content, while soap dispensers
            reportedly run low. Disposable masks, meant for one use, are often only replenished every two weeks.

            <br><br>

            Meanwhile, ICE has closed accountability channels, discontinuing visitation hours, limiting attorney access,
            and banning tours by Congress and oversight groups. Even the courts have questioned ICE’s reporting; in an
            ACLU-driven lawsuit in Maryland, the federal district court judge condemned the sworn testimony from ICE
            Deputy Assistant Director for Healthcare Compliance Jennifer Moon as <a
                    href="https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/ices-lack-of-transparency-about-covid-19-in-detention-will-cost-lives/"
                    style="color:#275889">“demonstrably false.”</a>

            <br><br>

            Given these conditions, the 1,163 positive cases among ICE detainees come at no surprise. In fact, we must
            ask, are there more cases than those reported?

            <br><br>

            As the map demonstrates, cases are disproportionately concentrated in select facilities; just 7 detention
            centers account for half of all cases. Perhaps even more concerning, ICE has only tested 2,328 detainees
            nationwide, yielding a test-positivity rate of nearly 50%. In comparison, the United States general public
            reduced its test-positivity rate to almost 10%. The World Health Organization and leading epidemiologists
            recommend targeting that 10% positivity rate benchmark, maximum. ICE’s test-positivity rate sits at five
            times the benchmark.

            <br><br>

            The test-positivity rate is a valuable metric. Typically, only highly symptomatic individuals with
            pre-existing conditions can access rationed tests. Based on preliminary data, the <a
                    href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/05/05/coronavirus-ice-detention-rural-communities-186688"
                    style="color:#275889">strong correlation</a> between
            case growth and test growth indicates that if ICE tested more people, the total number of confirmed positive
            detainees would increase.

            <br><br>

            Furthermore, the data published by ICE is obscured by the exclusion of information on US Marshall Service
            inmates and prison staff. The US Marshall Service has yet to report data on confirmed COVID-19 cases. While
            the map exposes the COVID-19 crisis among ICE detainees, the map cannot clearly indicate the level of
            anxiety and sickness within each detention center.

            <br><br>

            Thus, the map does not tell the entire story. In order to better understand this hidden epidemic, more tests
            and information are needed.

            <br><br>

            Meanwhile, the COVID-19 continues to spread. ICE deports infected inmates to their home countries, transfers
            detainees between facilities across state borders, refuses to release inmates, cohorts exposed inmates
            together in groups of over 50, and denies immigrants adequate sanitation supplies.

            <br><br>

            The conditions inside ICE detention centers are costing lives. Already, two men in custody have died. How
            many lives must be lost before action is taken?

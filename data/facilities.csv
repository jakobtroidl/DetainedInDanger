Officials at Etowah consolidated two units into one, doubling the number of men sharing the space overnight. Late March, detainees asked to be screened by a nurse for Covid-19. It was a basic screening, Golding stressed, not a test for the coronavirus. Golding said a nurse told him he was “symptomatic” and provided him with Advil and allergy medication. Several other detainees were told the same — none were placed in quarantine. Also appears to be a lack of supplies like soap. 
BUT this is what ICE says: “There is no one in ICE custody at the Etowah County facility with suspected Covid-19. Rumors to the contrary are false and needlessly spread fear through misinformation.” Detainees now required to wear masks. Persons detained who are held on the county side for short term processing (up to 72 hours) are still being transferred in and out, up to 10 people a week. There's a bus that goes from Etowah to Louisiana (to LaSalle - Pine Prairie and Adams also receivers) and back twice weekly.
